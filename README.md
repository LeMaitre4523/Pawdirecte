[Aplim's EcoleDirecte](https://www.aplim.fr/EcoleDirecte) is an online platform used by schools to facilitate communication and administrative management. It gives teachers, students and parents access to information such as timetables, grades, absences, homework and messages. It simplifies day-to-day management and fosters greater collaboration between all stakeholders in the educational community.

Pawdirecte is a simple wrapper around [Aplim's EcoleDirecte](https://www.aplim.fr/EcoleDirecte) internal API.
